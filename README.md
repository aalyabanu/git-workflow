# Git Workflow

## Project Brief
The aim of this project is to create a simple web page to demonstrate basic HTML skills and my knowledge in Git Version Control and the Unix shell.

## Summary of Tech Stack
A basic HTML page that I designed the old fashioned way. Thereâ€™s no better way to truly understand how markup works than typing it out, one tag at a time, then opening it in a browser after applying my own style using CSS.
